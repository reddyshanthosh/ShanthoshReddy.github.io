                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>As an enthusiastic and forward-thinking individual deeply passionate about the dynamic realms of
                  Software Development, Automation, Business Intelligence analytics, and Business Process Management, I
                  am committed to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive transformative change and optimize
                  organizational performance. Currently pursuing a Master's in Management Information Systems at the
                  University of Illinois Springfield, I am set to graduate in May 2024, building upon a solid foundation established
                  during my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering.
                  My academic journey has been marked by excellence, reflected in a stellar GPA of 3.96, complemented by
                  certifications in Business Analytics and Business Process Management. Moreover, my dedication to
                  academic and professional excellence has been recognized through prestigious honors such as induction
                  into the Beta Gamma Sigma international society for collegiate schools of business and the receipt of
                  the Chicoine Scholarship at the University of Illinois Springfield.</p>

                <p>Equipped with a diverse skill set encompassing programming languages, frameworks and Business Intelligence systems such as Python, SQL, React,
                  Vue.js, Laravel, Tableau and Power BI, I have actively applied these competencies in various roles to drive impactful
                  outcomes. My experience spans across internships and positions in renowned organizations, including
                  software development, product analysis, software testing and automation engineering.
                  During my tenure as an intern at the ITS Department of the University of Illinois Springfield, I
                  demonstrated my proficiency in developing and testing web applications, showcasing adaptability and
                  compatibility skills through successful codebase migration and UI enhancements. Moreover, my stint as
                  a Software Test & Automation Engineer at Ari and as a Technical Product Analyst at Deluxe Corporation
                  allowed me to hone my abilities in automation, database management, and client support, culminating in
                  successful project executions and database migrations.
                </p>
                <p>As a Software Developer Intern at Resolve Tok Inc, I expanded my expertise in backend development and cloud integration, leveraging technologies such as Google Cloud Firestore and NodeJS
                  to enhance system functionalities and user experiences. As I continue to advance in my career, I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning, innovation,
                  and delivering tangible value through technology solutions. With a blend of academic rigor, hands-on
                  experience, and a passion for excellence, I am poised to make meaningful contributions to the dynamic
                  realm of information systems.
